## Short solution

- We will solve first exersise
- And we will go home :)

## Our data

```{r}
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 2, -1)
y <- c(5, -2, 7, 10, 1)
```

## And now answers!

The sample mean of X is equal to `r mean(x)`.

The sample variance of X is equal to `r var(x)`.

The sample standard deviation of X is equal to `r sd(x)`.

## Happy New Year
